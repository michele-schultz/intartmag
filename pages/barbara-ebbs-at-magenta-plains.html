     <p>  
	Barbara Ess brings a wide array of multimedia art to Magenta Plains
       </p>

<p> Ghostly silhouettes blurred at their edges drift across the surface of Barbara Ess photographs as though surfacing from a dream wavering in the distance between what is seen and what is felt Figures rooms and landscapes hover in a state of suspension caught between the familiarity of the everyday and the uncanny shimmer of the unknown In VIEWING ROOM III: Barbara Ess* the emotional charge lies in the fragile tension between presence and disappearance between the eye and its inability to hold steady the world it longs to grasp Visitors to this survey at Magenta Plains experience a visual language that dissolves certainty curated with reverence for Ess lifelong pursuit of unfixing photographic expectation the presentation invites guests to step into the wavering space she spent decades mapping </p>

<p> Ess signature pinhole photographs anchor the viewing rooms like portals their soft monochromatic surfaces drawing visitors into a perceptual fog The images feel less like documents and more like whispered confessions a street corner slipping into shadow lovers leaning toward one another in a moment that seems to fold the surrounding architecture inward The optical pull of the pinhole single vanishing point lures the viewer closer Time feels elastic here stretched thinned and suddenly dense even as Ess works with the simplest photographic apparatus The pictures unsettle as much as they enchant </p>

<p> Elsewhere images made with toy microscopes small telescopes and lo-fi devices complicate the experience Distances collapse boundaries blur An empty shoreline refuses to separate foreground from horizon A tilted interior compresses its occupants into a shallow airless plane Dust magnified like drifting debris interrupts the surface of the print Ess leans into the glitch the unintended artifact turning imperfection into the subject itself In these works perception becomes tremulous incomplete as if her camera were trying to see not the world but the spaces between beings </p>

<p> The sense of claustrophobia and drift that permeates the photographs echoes in Ess later video and sound projects Audio murmurs and low-frequency hums form a phantom architecture that visitors feel more than hear These works meditate on separation longing and the shifting border between the self and the not-self shaped by Ess deep connection to experimental music and performance in New Yorks downtown scene She resisted letting any medium define the limits of her vision </p>

<p> Yet it is the photographs without spectacle — the faint legs of a dog the boatlike form on a dissolving horizon — that linger longest They hover at the seam between perception and involuntary memory refusing revelation retreating into an afterimage that flickers just beneath recognition </p>

<p> Barbara Ess born in Brooklyn in 1944 spent her life navigating this unstable terrain Educated at the University of Michigan and the London School of Film Technique she returned to New York with generative urgency moving between photography performance publishing and sound She exhibited widely in the US and Europe with retrospectives at the Queens Museum the Center for Fine Arts Miami and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta Her work is held in major collections including the Whitney Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, SFMOMA, MOCA Los Angeles, the Pompidou Center and the Smithsonian Institution She taught for over two decades as Associate Professor of Photography at Bard College </p>

<p> VIEWING ROOM III is on view from November 6 to December 20, 2025 at Magenta Plains located at 149 Canal Street, New York, NY 10002 In a historical moment awash with images promising clarity her photographs feel radical and deeply human reminding us that to see is always to lose something and in that blur new meanings quietly emerge </p>
